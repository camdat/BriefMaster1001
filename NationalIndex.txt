II. ANSWERS TO CASES CURTAILING BULK DATA 
 COLLECTION AND STORAGE UNDER SECTION 215

 exaggerated. 
 1. Privacy is not impaired by bulk collection. (581-583) 
 2. Strict limits are imposed on accessing data in the 
 collection. (584-589) 
3. Metadata only is collected - not the actual content of the 
 communications. (590-595) 
4. Only a tiny amount of data is ever actually examined. 
 (596-597) 
5. Section 215 is commonly referred to as the --libraries‖ 
  collection provision, but it has never even been used to 
  request library records. (598) 
B. The NSA use of bulk data collection is justified in the war 
 o n t e r r o r is m . 
1. Domestic surveillance is critically important in the war 
 o n te r r o r is m . ( 5 9 9 )

 investigation. (600-601)

 610)

 necessary in intelligence collection. (611)

 tool in the war on terrorism. (612-617) 
8. Numerous court rulings have found that the NSA bulk 
  collection system is legal under the PATRIOT Act. 
  (618-622) 
C. Existing checks on NSA bulk collection of telephone 
 metadata are sufficient. 
 1. Numerous checks are in place. (623-626) 
 2. The FISA Court is no mere --rubber stamp.‖ (627)

9. The --gag order‖ provision of the PATRIOT Act has been 
lifted. (634-645) 
10. President Obama has eliminated the --third hop‖ in the 
 Section 215 surveillance process. (646-649) 
D. Proposals to curtail the NSA's bulk collection of metadata 
  will not solve the threat to the privacy of telephone m e t a da t a . 
1. The use of --stingray‖ devices to mimic the operation of 
  cellphone towers is not limited to government - private companies and even electronics hobbyists can intercept 
  this data. (650-675) 
2. The proposal to have private companies store metadata is 
  a non-starter because they are not interested in 
  maintaining such a database. (676) 
E. Proposals to the bulk collection of telephone metadata will 
 undermine the ability to prevent terrorist attacks. 
1. Limiting NSA bulk collection would assist terrorists. 
 (677-679) 
2. Section 215 may not be the most important anti-terror 
  tool, but it losing it will make it more difficult to 
  identify terrorist plots. (680) 
3. Abandoning bulk collection is like getting rid of airbags 
  on a car based on the theory that they haven't been 
  needed so far. (681) 
4. Reliance on private database storage represents a greater 
  threat to privacy than bulk government collection. (682- 
  686) 
5. Creating a private storage requirement would destroy the 
  ability to compete in the marketplace for U.S. 
  telecommunication companies. (687) 
6. The institution of a specific warrant requirement would 
 destroy the value of the Section 215 program. (688-690) 
7. Requiring opposing counsel to appear before the FISA 
Court is problematic. (691-695)

2. Our society properly evaluates security as more 
  important than privacy when the two are in conflict.

  many demands on Internet companies. (711)

 protected. (712) 
 5. Anonymity is now a thing of the past. (713)

c. The role of a free Internet in promoting democracy is 
 over-rated. (722) 
 8. Big data is generally good. (723)

  737)

 tracking. (758-761) 
12. Internet freedom is a pillar of U.S. foreign policy. (762- 
763)
